=== true
`true` is often said to be defined as 1, which is correct, but true has a wider definition. Any integer which is non-zero is true, in a Boolean sense. So -1, 2 and -200 are all defined as true, too, in a Boolean sense.

Note that the `true` and `false` constants are typed in lowercase unlike `HIGH`, `LOW`, `INPUT`, and `OUTPUT`.
