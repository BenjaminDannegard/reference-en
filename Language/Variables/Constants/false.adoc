== Defining Logical Levels: true and false (Boolean Constants)
There are two constants used to represent truth and falsity in the Arduino language: `true`, and `false`.

[float]
`false` is the easier of the two to define. false is defined as 0 (zero).

Note that the `true` and `false` constants are typed in lowercase unlike `HIGH`, `LOW`, `INPUT`, and `OUTPUT`.
